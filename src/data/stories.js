    text: `She woke up with motivation.
It disappeared almost immediately,
but it did exist for a moment.

The day started with good intentions.
Very confident intentions.
The kind that sound impressive in your head
and quietly vanish by breakfast.

She made a mental list.
Forgot half of it.
Added new things that weren’t urgent.
Got stressed about all of it anyway.

At some point, she realized
she was tired without actually doing anything exhausting.
Which felt unfair, but also on-brand.

Still, she moved through the day.
Not gracefully.
Not efficiently.
But consistently enough to count as trying.

And that’s the thing no one really says out loud:
some days aren’t about winning.
They’re about not fully giving up.

Today didn’t fix anything.
But it didn’t spiral either.

A quiet success, honestly.

If you think there’s something hidden here, write it down.
It’s probably something simple.
The kind of thing you reach for without thinking.`,
    hint: `It’s something you reach for
before your brain fully wakes up.
It doesn’t solve anything—
it just helps you start.`
