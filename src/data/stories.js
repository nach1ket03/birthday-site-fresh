There are a few things she always carries with her.

Not in her bag.
Those change.

These are less obvious.

She carries the ability to stay calm when plans don’t work out.
She carries questions she never asks out loud.
She carries a mental list of things she needs to remember for other people.

She carries the habit of double-checking decisions, feelings.
She carries an almost embarrassing amount of consideration.
She carries the belief that if she just handles things well enough, everything will be fine.

Most days, it is.

She also carries contradictions.

She wants certainty but enjoys surprise.
She likes quiet but hates being bored.
She says she’s “not in the mood” and then shows up anyway.

There are things she leaves behind too.

She leaves unfinished cups of coffee.
She leaves rooms slightly better than she found them.
She leaves impressions on people without meaning to.

If someone were cataloguing her life carefully,
they’d notice that none of this looks dramatic.

But it’s consistent.
And consistency is underrated.

Today doesn’t ask her to change anything.
It doesn’t require reflection or intention.

It’s just a note in the margin that says:

This version of you exists.
And it’s doing more than it thinks.`,
    hint: `It’s something that exists only because someone took time to sit and write.
It’s meant to be opened slowly.`

There are things she takes seriously.
This is not one of them.

She prefers certain spoons.
Certain playlists for certain moods.
Certain seats, even though she’ll say she doesn’t care where she sits.

She absolutely cares.

She has opinions about how hot coffee should be.
About whether days feel better when they start slow or end slow.
About replying immediately versus “in a bit” (which can mean anything).

She would never call these rules.
That would sound intense.

They’re just… preferences.
Quiet ones.
The kind that make days easier without announcing themselves.

She’ll say she’s flexible.
And she is.
As long as flexibility doesn’t involve bad coffee or unnecessary chaos.

She doesn’t make a personality out of these things.
She doesn’t explain them.
She just lives accordingly.

Most people wouldn’t notice.
But if they did, they’d realize something simple:

She knows what she likes.
And she’s surprisingly consistent about it.

Today isn’t about meaning or growth or reflection.

It’s just a reminder that even the smallest details 
the ones she pretends don’t matter
are quietly shaping the way her days feel.

And honestly?
That’s kind of nice.`,
    hint: `It’s something small that stays close.
You don’t notice it all the time only when it moves.`

    text: `She watches a lot of reels.

    Whenever she's free. Between study sessions. While eating. Before bed. During the small pockets of time that don't belong to anything else.

    It's not mindless, exactly. She's present for it. Laughing at something ridiculous, saving recipes she'll never make, watching pet videos that remind her of her Jack and gang.

    But here's what happens sometimes:

    She'll see something. A thought. An idea. A line from a song or a quote that lands differently than usual. Something that makes her pause mid-scroll.

    And she'll think, "I should remember this."

    But the reel keeps playing. The next one starts. The algorithm pulls her forward. And the thought? Gone. Dissolved back into the endless scroll.

    Five minutes later she can't remember what it was.

    Just that it felt important for a second.

    It's not that she needs to write everything down. Most of it isn't worth keeping. But occasionally, just occasionally, there's something worth holding onto. A reminder. A small truth. A thing she wants to come back to when her brain isn't being pulled in seventeen directions.

    She's tried typing notes into her phone. But her phone is also where the distraction lives. Opening notes means notifications, messages, the pull back into the scroll.

    The thought needs a different place to land.

    Somewhere analog. Separate. Small enough to keep nearby but apart from the chaos.`,

    hint: `For the thoughts that almost got away.`

    text: `She has a couple of books.

    Not many. Just a few that made their way to her over time gifts, recommendations, things she thought she'd read someday.

    They sit on her desk or her shelf, sometimes stacked, sometimes leaning against each other. She doesn't reach for them often.

    It's not that she doesn't like reading. She just doesn't make time for it. Her day is full study, family, Jack, the cats, reels on her phone whenever there's a gap. Books require a different kind of attention. Longer. Slower. Less interruptible.

    So they wait.

    Every now and then, she'll pick one up. Flip through it. Read a few pages while lying in bed, or during a slow afternoon when her brain is too tired for actual studying but too awake to nap.

    She'll get a chapter in, maybe two. It's nice. Quiet. A different pace from everything else.

    And then she puts it down.

    Not because it's bad. Just because something else calls her attention. A message. A thought. The need to do something that feels more urgent even if it isn't.

    The book stays where she left it. Open, or closed with a corner folded, or face-down holding its own place.

    She'll come back to it eventually. Maybe weeks later. Maybe months.

    Or maybe she won't.

    The books don't seem to mind. They're patient in a way nothing else in her life is required to be.`,
    hint: `For the few that wait quietly`
