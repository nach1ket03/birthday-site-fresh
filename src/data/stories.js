There are a few things she always carries with her.

Not in her bag.
Those change.

These are less obvious.

She carries the ability to stay calm when plans don’t work out.
She carries questions she never asks out loud.
She carries a mental list of things she needs to remember for other people.

She carries the habit of double-checking decisions, feelings.
She carries an almost embarrassing amount of consideration.
She carries the belief that if she just handles things well enough, everything will be fine.

Most days, it is.

She also carries contradictions.

She wants certainty but enjoys surprise.
She likes quiet but hates being bored.
She says she’s “not in the mood” and then shows up anyway.

There are things she leaves behind too.

She leaves unfinished cups of coffee.
She leaves rooms slightly better than she found them.
She leaves impressions on people without meaning to.

If someone were cataloguing her life carefully,
they’d notice that none of this looks dramatic.

But it’s consistent.
And consistency is underrated.

Today doesn’t ask her to change anything.
It doesn’t require reflection or intention.

It’s just a note in the margin that says:

This version of you exists.
And it’s doing more than it thinks.`,
    hint: `It’s something that exists only because someone took time to sit and write.
It’s meant to be opened slowly.`
