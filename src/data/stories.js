There are a few things she always carries with her.

Not in her bag.
Those change.

These are less obvious.

She carries the ability to stay calm when plans don’t work out.
She carries questions she never asks out loud.
She carries a mental list of things she needs to remember for other people.

She carries the habit of double-checking decisions, feelings.
She carries an almost embarrassing amount of consideration.
She carries the belief that if she just handles things well enough, everything will be fine.

Most days, it is.

She also carries contradictions.

She wants certainty but enjoys surprise.
She likes quiet but hates being bored.
She says she’s “not in the mood” and then shows up anyway.

There are things she leaves behind too.

She leaves unfinished cups of coffee.
She leaves rooms slightly better than she found them.
She leaves impressions on people without meaning to.

If someone were cataloguing her life carefully,
they’d notice that none of this looks dramatic.

But it’s consistent.
And consistency is underrated.

Today doesn’t ask her to change anything.
It doesn’t require reflection or intention.

It’s just a note in the margin that says:

This version of you exists.
And it’s doing more than it thinks.`,
    hint: `It’s something that exists only because someone took time to sit and write.
It’s meant to be opened slowly.`

    text: `A Small, Unimportant List

There are things she takes seriously.
This is not one of them.

She prefers certain spoons.
Certain playlists for certain moods.
Certain seats, even though she’ll say she doesn’t care where she sits.

She absolutely cares.

She has opinions about how hot coffee should be.
About whether days feel better when they start slow or end slow.
About replying immediately versus “in a bit” (which can mean anything).

She would never call these rules.
That would sound intense.

They’re just… preferences.
Quiet ones.
The kind that make days easier without announcing themselves.

She’ll say she’s flexible.
And she is.
As long as flexibility doesn’t involve bad coffee or unnecessary chaos.

She doesn’t make a personality out of these things.
She doesn’t explain them.
She just lives accordingly.

Most people wouldn’t notice.
But if they did, they’d realize something simple:

She knows what she likes.
And she’s surprisingly consistent about it.

Today isn’t about meaning or growth or reflection.

It’s just a reminder that even the smallest details 
the ones she pretends don’t matter
are quietly shaping the way her days feel.

And honestly?
That’s kind of nice.`,
    hint: `It’s something small that stays close.
You don’t notice it all the time only when it moves.`

    text: `She watches a lot of reels.

    Whenever she's free. Between study sessions. While eating. Before bed. During the small pockets of time that don't belong to anything else.

    It's not mindless, exactly. She's present for it. Laughing at something ridiculous, saving recipes she'll never make, watching pet videos that remind her of her Jack and gang.

    But here's what happens sometimes:

    She'll see something. A thought. An idea. A line from a song or a quote that lands differently than usual. Something that makes her pause mid-scroll.

    And she'll think, "I should remember this."

    But the reel keeps playing. The next one starts. The algorithm pulls her forward. And the thought? Gone. Dissolved back into the endless scroll.

    Five minutes later she can't remember what it was.

    Just that it felt important for a second.

    It's not that she needs to write everything down. Most of it isn't worth keeping. But occasionally, just occasionally, there's something worth holding onto. A reminder. A small truth. A thing she wants to come back to when her brain isn't being pulled in seventeen directions.

    She's tried typing notes into her phone. But her phone is also where the distraction lives. Opening notes means notifications, messages, the pull back into the scroll.

    The thought needs a different place to land.

    Somewhere analog. Separate. Small enough to keep nearby but apart from the chaos.`,

    text: `She has a couple of books.

    Not many. Just a few that made their way to her over time gifts, recommendations, things she thought she'd read someday.

    They sit on her desk or her shelf, sometimes stacked, sometimes leaning against each other. She doesn't reach for them often.

    It's not that she doesn't like reading. She just doesn't make time for it. Her day is full study, family, Jack, the cats, reels on her phone whenever there's a gap. Books require a different kind of attention. Longer. Slower. Less interruptible.

    So they wait.

    Every now and then, she'll pick one up. Flip through it. Read a few pages while lying in bed, or during a slow afternoon when her brain is too tired for actual studying but too awake to nap.

    She'll get a chapter in, maybe two. It's nice. Quiet. A different pace from everything else.

    And then she puts it down.

    Not because it's bad. Just because something else calls her attention. A message. A thought. The need to do something that feels more urgent even if it isn't.

    The book stays where she left it. Open, or closed with a corner folded, or face-down holding its own place.

    She'll come back to it eventually. Maybe weeks later. Maybe months.

    Or maybe she won't.

    The books don't seem to mind. They're patient in a way nothing else in her life is required to be.`,
    hint: `For the few that wait quietly`

    text: `She takes her time getting ready to go out.

    Not in a stressed way. Just thorough.

    The process starts with a question: where is she going?

    Casual errand? Easy. Grab something comfortable, done.

    But if it's somewhere that involves being seen a family function, a dinner, anywhere people will notice then the real work begins.

    She'll pull something from her wardrobe. Hold it up. Consider it. Put it back. Try another option. Look in the mirror. Tilt her head. Does this work? Does this feel right for the occasion?

    Her room, already chaotic, gets slightly worse. Clothes on the chair. A dupatta on the bed. The first choice hanging off the door.

    I learned not to ask "Are you ready?" too early. The answer is always "almost," which could mean five minutes or twenty-five.

    Once the outfit is decided, the rest follows.

    Hair up in a scrunchie adjusted twice, maybe three times. Lip balm, then lip gloss on top. No exceptions. Doesn't matter if it's a wedding or groceries.

    Jewelry next. The daily stud comes out, replaced with earrings that match. If it's a bigger occasion, she'll add more.

    Final mirror check. Top to bottom. Does everything work?

    Sometimes she'll notice something no one else would see. A loose thread. The angle of her dupatta. She fixes it anyway.

    Bag gets packed last. Lip balm, sanitizer, lip gloss. Phone. Keys transferred from yesterday's bag.

    Then, finally, she's ready.

    The going out version of herself is more polished than the at-home version. Not because home-her is lesser. Just because going-out-her has a role to play.

    Even the details no one else will see.

    Especially those.`,

    text: `She takes a lot of photos.

    Not of landscapes or aesthetic shots of her coffee or perfectly composed moments. Just... life. The stuff that's happening around her.

    Jack mid yawn. One of the cats doing something ridiculous. Food before she eats it every single time, no exceptions. Herself, from angles she's testing to see which one works best today.

    Her phone gallery is thousands of images deep. Most of them will never be looked at again. She doesn't delete them, though. They just accumulate. Evidence that these moments happened, even if she never scrolls back to check.

    Sometimes she'll take five versions of the same thing. Trying to get the light right, or the angle, or just because the first one didn't feel quite enough.

    It's not vanity. It's not even about getting the perfect shot. It's more like she's collecting proof. Of the food she ate. Of the pets she loves. Of herself existing in this specific moment, wearing this specific thing, feeling however she felt right then.

    Her phone is always in her hand or within reach. Always checking it. Not just for messages or reels, though that's part of it. Just... present. An extension of her.

    The case it lives in gets beaten up fast. Scratched. Worn at the edges. It holds the thing she touches most in a day, so of course it does.

    But it's blank. Functional. Protective, but impersonal.

    Which is strange, considering how much of her life gets captured and stored inside it.`,

    text: `She has a recurring announcement she makes with complete seriousness:

    "I'm cutting sugar. For real this time."

    It comes every few weeks. Sometimes after scrolling health content on reels. Sometimes after a family member makes a comment. Sometimes just because she woke up and decided today is the day she becomes the disciplined version of herself who doesn't need dessert.

    She'll say it out loud. Tell her family. Maybe even tell her friends. The commitment is public. Official. Binding.

    "No more sweets. I'm done."

    Her parents nod. They've heard this before. They don't argue.

    The resolve is genuine. She means it. For the next 48 hours, maybe longer, she'll actually follow through. Turn down mithai. Skip dessert. Feel virtuous about it.

    And then.

    After dinner. When she's full but not satisfied. When everyone's winding down and her brain is tired from studying and her phone is playing reels that somehow all feature dessert.

    The text arrives:

    "Should I have sugar-free ice cream or waffle?"

    Or:

    "Mumma and baba want ice cream but they're saying if I don't have it, they won't eat it either. What do I do?"

    Or, the most honest version:

    "I'm craving it SO much. Just this once. I'll start again tomorrow."

    The "just this once" has happened approximately 47 times.

    She knows this. Is fully aware. Will even laugh about it mid-bite.

    "I know. I literally said I was cutting sugar yesterday."

    Pause.

    "But this doesn't count because family pressure, bad day, special occasion, Mercury in retrograde, etc."

    The cycle is predictable:

    Day 1: Declaration of intent. Sugar is the enemy. Willpower activated.

    Day 2-4: Success. Feeling great. Definitely never eating sugar again.

    Day 5: A craving appears. Small. Manageable.

    Day 6: The craving grows. Becomes loud.

    Day 7: "Just this once."

    Day 8: (Optional) Guilt.

    Day 9: "Okay, I'm cutting sugar again. For real this time."

    Her family has stopped taking the announcements seriously. They just smile and wait.

    They know she'll be back at the dessert table within the week, pretending her parents forced her to eat it so they wouldn't feel bad.

    Which, to be fair, is sometimes actually true.

    But mostly it's just that the morning version of her the one who makes declarations doesn't account for the after dinner version of her, who is tired and wants something sweet and doesn't want to negotiate with her own cravings anymore.

    Both versions are her.

    Both are equally convinced they're right.

    Though, honestly, nothing she craves after dinner could ever be sweeter than the smile she gives when she's caught in the contradiction.

    That one's sugar-free.

    And completely worth it.`,

    Enough of stories for a week. You must be tired by now, right?
    Let's take a break. Here's a poem instead.

    <b>On Her Hair</b>

<em>The first time that we met, it was the bangs,
not styled with perfect care or fancy tangs,
just falling soft across her forehead there
effortless, like she didn't know I'd stare.

She probably just woke and checked the mirror,
decided they looked fine, the choice was clearer,
then tied her hair and moved on with her day,
while I stayed stuck on details she'd display.

Her hair has always held a gentle wave,
not curly tight, not straight like those who save
their mornings fighting with a brush and heat
just in between, unpredictable, but sweet.

It moves the way she moves, it falls and sways,
it changes shape depending on the days,
she'll tie it up without a second thought,
and somehow make it look like something sought.

The bangs are gone now, grown and swept aside,
replaced by whatever comes with time and tide,
but still that wave remains, still soft, still true,
still catching light in ways I notice through.

Some beauty shouts and demands you see,
announces its arrival, bold and free.
But other beauty's quieter, it stays
like sunlight through a window, hair that sways,
like moments that refuse to fade away,
like bangs from our first meeting, on that day.

Those bangs were that a detail, small but clear.

Her hair still is. Still beautiful. Still here.<em>

    hint: `For the waves that don't need fixing.
