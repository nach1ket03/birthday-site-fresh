There are a few things she always carries with her.

Not in her bag.
Those change.

These are less obvious.

She carries the ability to stay calm when plans don’t work out.
She carries questions she never asks out loud.
She carries a mental list of things she needs to remember for other people.

She carries the habit of double-checking decisions, feelings.
She carries an almost embarrassing amount of consideration.
She carries the belief that if she just handles things well enough, everything will be fine.

Most days, it is.

She also carries contradictions.

She wants certainty but enjoys surprise.
She likes quiet but hates being bored.
She says she’s “not in the mood” and then shows up anyway.

There are things she leaves behind too.

She leaves unfinished cups of coffee.
She leaves rooms slightly better than she found them.
She leaves impressions on people without meaning to.

If someone were cataloguing her life carefully,
they’d notice that none of this looks dramatic.

But it’s consistent.
And consistency is underrated.

Today doesn’t ask her to change anything.
It doesn’t require reflection or intention.

It’s just a note in the margin that says:

This version of you exists.
And it’s doing more than it thinks.`,
    hint: `It’s something that exists only because someone took time to sit and write.
It’s meant to be opened slowly.`

    text: `A Small, Unimportant List

There are things she takes seriously.
This is not one of them.

She prefers certain spoons.
Certain playlists for certain moods.
Certain seats, even though she’ll say she doesn’t care where she sits.

She absolutely cares.

She has opinions about how hot coffee should be.
About whether days feel better when they start slow or end slow.
About replying immediately versus “in a bit” (which can mean anything).

She would never call these rules.
That would sound intense.

They’re just… preferences.
Quiet ones.
The kind that make days easier without announcing themselves.

She’ll say she’s flexible.
And she is.
As long as flexibility doesn’t involve bad coffee or unnecessary chaos.

She doesn’t make a personality out of these things.
She doesn’t explain them.
She just lives accordingly.

Most people wouldn’t notice.
But if they did, they’d realize something simple:

She knows what she likes.
And she’s surprisingly consistent about it.

Today isn’t about meaning or growth or reflection.

It’s just a reminder that even the smallest details 
the ones she pretends don’t matter
are quietly shaping the way her days feel.

And honestly?
That’s kind of nice.`,

You don’t notice it all the time only when it moves.`

    text: `She watches a lot of reels.

    Whenever she's free. Between study sessions. While eating. Before bed. During the small pockets of time that don't belong to anything else.

    It's not mindless, exactly. She's present for it. Laughing at something ridiculous, saving recipes she'll never make, watching pet videos that remind her of her Jack and gang.

    But here's what happens sometimes:

    She'll see something. A thought. An idea. A line from a song or a quote that lands differently than usual. Something that makes her pause mid-scroll.

    And she'll think, "I should remember this."

    But the reel keeps playing. The next one starts. The algorithm pulls her forward. And the thought? Gone. Dissolved back into the endless scroll.

    Five minutes later she can't remember what it was.

    Just that it felt important for a second.

    It's not that she needs to write everything down. Most of it isn't worth keeping. But occasionally, just occasionally, there's something worth holding onto. A reminder. A small truth. A thing she wants to come back to when her brain isn't being pulled in seventeen directions.

    She's tried typing notes into her phone. But her phone is also where the distraction lives. Opening notes means notifications, messages, the pull back into the scroll.

    The thought needs a different place to land.

    Not many. Just a few that made their way to her over time gifts, recommendations, things she thought she'd read someday.

    They sit on her desk or her shelf, sometimes stacked, sometimes leaning against each other. She doesn't reach for them often.

    It's not that she doesn't like reading. She just doesn't make time for it. Her day is full study, family, Jack, the cats, reels on her phone whenever there's a gap. Books require a different kind of attention. Longer. Slower. Less interruptible.

    So they wait.

    Every now and then, she'll pick one up. Flip through it. Read a few pages while lying in bed, or during a slow afternoon when her brain is too tired for actual studying but too awake to nap.

    She'll get a chapter in, maybe two. It's nice. Quiet. A different pace from everything else.

    And then she puts it down.

    Not because it's bad. Just because something else calls her attention. A message. A thought. The need to do something that feels more urgent even if it isn't.

    The book stays where she left it. Open, or closed with a corner folded, or face-down holding its own place.

    She'll come back to it eventually. Maybe weeks later. Maybe months.

    Or maybe she won't.

    text: `She takes her time getting ready to go out.

    Not in a stressed way. Just thorough.

    The process starts with a question: where is she going?

    Casual errand? Easy. Grab something comfortable, done.

    But if it's somewhere that involves being seen a family function, a dinner, anywhere people will notice then the real work begins.

    She'll pull something from her wardrobe. Hold it up. Consider it. Put it back. Try another option. Look in the mirror. Tilt her head. Does this work? Does this feel right for the occasion?

    Her room, already chaotic, gets slightly worse. Clothes on the chair. A dupatta on the bed. The first choice hanging off the door.

    I learned not to ask "Are you ready?" too early. The answer is always "almost," which could mean five minutes or twenty-five.

    Once the outfit is decided, the rest follows.

    Hair up in a scrunchie adjusted twice, maybe three times. Lip balm, then lip gloss on top. No exceptions. Doesn't matter if it's a wedding or groceries.

    Jewelry next. The daily stud comes out, replaced with earrings that match. If it's a bigger occasion, she'll add more.

    Final mirror check. Top to bottom. Does everything work?

    Sometimes she'll notice something no one else would see. A loose thread. The angle of her dupatta. She fixes it anyway.

    Bag gets packed last. Lip balm, sanitizer, lip gloss. Phone. Keys transferred from yesterday's bag.

    Then, finally, she's ready.

    The going out version of herself is more polished than the at-home version. Not because home-her is lesser. Just because going-out-her has a role to play.

    Not of landscapes or aesthetic shots of her coffee or perfectly composed moments. Just... life. The stuff that's happening around her.

    Jack mid yawn. One of the cats doing something ridiculous. Food before she eats it every single time, no exceptions. Herself, from angles she's testing to see which one works best today.

    Her phone gallery is thousands of images deep. Most of them will never be looked at again. She doesn't delete them, though. They just accumulate. Evidence that these moments happened, even if she never scrolls back to check.

    Sometimes she'll take five versions of the same thing. Trying to get the light right, or the angle, or just because the first one didn't feel quite enough.

    It's not vanity. It's not even about getting the perfect shot. It's more like she's collecting proof. Of the food she ate. Of the pets she loves. Of herself existing in this specific moment, wearing this specific thing, feeling however she felt right then.

    Her phone is always in her hand or within reach. Always checking it. Not just for messages or reels, though that's part of it. Just... present. An extension of her.

    The case it lives in gets beaten up fast. Scratched. Worn at the edges. It holds the thing she touches most in a day, so of course it does.

    "I'm cutting sugar. For real this time."

    It comes every few weeks. Sometimes after scrolling health content on reels. Sometimes after a family member makes a comment. Sometimes just because she woke up and decided today is the day she becomes the disciplined version of herself who doesn't need dessert.

    She'll say it out loud. Tell her family. Maybe even tell her friends. The commitment is public. Official. Binding.

    "No more sweets. I'm done."

    Her parents nod. They've heard this before. They don't argue.

    The resolve is genuine. She means it. For the next 48 hours, maybe longer, she'll actually follow through. Turn down mithai. Skip dessert. Feel virtuous about it.

    And then.

    After dinner. When she's full but not satisfied. When everyone's winding down and her brain is tired from studying and her phone is playing reels that somehow all feature dessert.

    The text arrives:

    "Should I have sugar-free ice cream or waffle?"

    Or:

    "Mumma and baba want ice cream but they're saying if I don't have it, they won't eat it either. What do I do?"

    Or, the most honest version:

    "I'm craving it SO much. Just this once. I'll start again tomorrow."

    The "just this once" has happened approximately 47 times.

    She knows this. Is fully aware. Will even laugh about it mid-bite.

    "I know. I literally said I was cutting sugar yesterday."

    Pause.

    "But this doesn't count because family pressure, bad day, special occasion, Mercury in retrograde, etc."

    The cycle is predictable:

    Day 1: Declaration of intent. Sugar is the enemy. Willpower activated.

    Day 2-4: Success. Feeling great. Definitely never eating sugar again.

    Day 5: A craving appears. Small. Manageable.

    Day 6: The craving grows. Becomes loud.

    Day 7: "Just this once."

    Day 8: (Optional) Guilt.

    Day 9: "Okay, I'm cutting sugar again. For real this time."

    Her family has stopped taking the announcements seriously. They just smile and wait.

    They know she'll be back at the dessert table within the week, pretending her parents forced her to eat it so they wouldn't feel bad.

    Which, to be fair, is sometimes actually true.

    But mostly it's just that the morning version of her the one who makes declarations doesn't account for the after dinner version of her, who is tired and wants something sweet and doesn't want to negotiate with her own cravings anymore.

    Both versions are her.

    Both are equally convinced they're right.

    Though, honestly, nothing she craves after dinner could ever be sweeter than the smile she gives when she's caught in the contradiction.

    That one's sugar-free.

    Enough of stories for a week. You must be tired by now, right?
    Let's take a break. Here's a poem instead.

    <b>On Her Hair</b>

<em>The first time that we met, it was the bangs,
not styled with perfect care or fancy tangs,
just falling soft across her forehead there
effortless, like she didn't know I'd stare.

She probably just woke and checked the mirror,
decided they looked fine, the choice was clearer,
then tied her hair and moved on with her day,
while I stayed stuck on details she'd display.

Her hair has always held a gentle wave,
not curly tight, not straight like those who save
their mornings fighting with a brush and heat
just in between, unpredictable, but sweet.

It moves the way she moves, it falls and sways,
it changes shape depending on the days,
she'll tie it up without a second thought,
and somehow make it look like something sought.

The bangs are gone now, grown and swept aside,
replaced by whatever comes with time and tide,
but still that wave remains, still soft, still true,
still catching light in ways I notice through.

Some beauty shouts and demands you see,
announces its arrival, bold and free.
But other beauty's quieter, it stays
like sunlight through a window, hair that sways,
like moments that refuse to fade away,
like bangs from our first meeting, on that day.

Those bangs were that a detail, small but clear.

Her hair still is. Still beautiful. Still here.<em>

    text: `She didn't know how to embroider.

    Had never done it before. Probably never thought about doing it.

    But she had an idea for a gift, and the idea required a skill she didn't have.

    So she learned.

    Not casually. Not half committed. She actually sat down and taught herself from scratch.

    Watched tutorials. Rewound them when the steps didn't make sense. Practiced on scraps of fabric until her fingers understood what her eyes were seeing. Figured out how thread tension works, how to keep stitches even, how to make letters look like letters and not just optimistic lines.

    She messed up. Obviously. Started over. Pulled out stitches that didn't sit right. Tried again.

    No one asked her to do this. No one was watching. She could have bought something easier, something ready made, something that wouldn't require hours of learning a new skill just to execute one idea.

    But that's not what she did.

    She bought a hoodie. Stitched a name across it careful, deliberate, imperfect in all the ways that prove a human made it. The letters weren't perfectly uniform. Some stitches were tighter than others. You could see  where her hand corrected itself mid word, where the learning happened in real time.

    And somehow that made it better.

    Because the imperfections weren't flaws. They were evidence. Proof that she'd started with nothing and built something anyway. That the gift wasn't just the hoodie, it was the hours spent learning how to make it exist.

    That hoodie still gets worn.

    Not because it's the warmest or the best made or the most expensive. But because wearing it feels different. There's a weight to it that has nothing to do with fabric. A warmth that comes from knowing someone cared enough to learn something difficult just to give it.

    Most gifts are chosen. Picked from a shelf or a website. Wrapped and handed over.

    This one was built. Thread by thread. Mistake by mistake. Hour by hour.

    That's the difference.

    And it's the kind of difference that doesn't fade.

    Some people give what's easy.

    She gave what took effort.

    And that effort is still felt, every time the hoodie gets pulled on. Every time the stitches catch the light. Every time the memory of how it came to exist resurfaces quietly, unannounced.

    She's someone who doesn't just have ideas.

    She learns what's needed to make them real.`,

    text: `She has lunch early.

    Not by choice, exactly. Just how the day unfolds. Family rhythm. Timing that works for everyone else, so she goes with it.

    By late afternoon, she's hungry again.

    Not starving. Just aware that lunch was hours ago and dinner is still hours away and her stomach is starting to lodge a formal complaint.

    So she tries to solve it.

    First thought: order something.

    She'll open the food app. Scroll through options. Add something to cart. Stare at the total.

    Then the guilt kicks in.

    "I can't order every day. It's not good to have outside food daily."

    She deletes the cart.

    Second thought: make something.

    She'll stand in the kitchen. Survey the ingredients. Consider the effort required. Think about how this exact scenario will happen again tomorrow. And the day after.

    "How can I make everything daily?"

    The answer is: she can't. Or won't. Or doesn't want to commit to that level of daily cooking for a snack that only she will eat.

    Third thought: find something already made.

    She opens the cupboard. Scans the shelves.

    Chips from three days ago almost empty. Biscuits? boring. Something her parents bought that she doesn't particularly want.

    Nothing feels right.

    She closes the cupboard.

    Opens the fridge. Looks inside. Closes it.

    Checks the cupboard again, as if something new might have appeared in the last thirty seconds.

    It hasn't.

    So she gives up. Goes back to her room. Lies down. Scrolls reels. Tells herself she's not that hungry.

    An hour later, the cycle repeats.

    It's not that food doesn't exist in the house. It's that the food that exists requires either effort or compromise, and she's not in the mood for either.

    What she wants is something easy. Ready. Satisfying without being a whole production.

    But that thing is rarely just sitting there waiting for her.

    So she stays hungry. Or eats something suboptimal. Or eventually orders anyway and feels mildly guilty about it.

    <strong>Umm, I don't actually have anything specific to write for today's gift.
So here's the thing, I like her the most for.</strong>
    
    She's funnier than she gets credit for.

    Not in the loud, center of attention way. Not with rehearsed jokes or trying too hard humor.

    Just naturally funny in the way people are when they're not performing.

    She'll say something completely deadpan "abe saale" and it lands perfectly because the timing is effortless. She's not trying to be funny. She just is.

    She laughs at her own jokes before she finishes telling them. Starts giggling mid sentence, can barely get the punchline out. And somehow that becomes the funniest part. Not the joke itself, but her inability to deliver it without cracking up.

    It's contagious. You end up laughing at her laughing, and by then no one even remembers what the original joke was.

    She doesn't interrupt people when they're talking. Waits for the natural pause. Listens first, speaks second.

    That's rarer than it should be.

    Most people are just waiting for their turn. Already composing their response while you're mid sentence.

    She actually pays attention. Absorbs what's being said. Responds to it instead of talking past it.

    Her laugh is quiet. Not the loud, room filling kind. Just soft. Almost like she's trying not to laugh too hard but can't quite help it.

    It's the kind of laugh that makes you want to say funnier things just to hear it again.

    She handles compliments like they're small inconveniences.

    "You look nice."

    "I know, right?"

    No false modesty. No brushing it off. Just... agreement. Confidence without arrogance.

    It's refreshing.

    She doesn't apologize when she doesn't need to. Doesn't over-explain herself. Doesn't shrink to make other people comfortable.

    She just exists at her full size and lets that be enough.

    There's a specific kind of peace that comes from being around someone who isn't trying to manage your perception of them.

    She's just herself. Consistent. Unapologetic. Easy.

    And that ease makes everything lighter.`,

    text:`When life gets too loud, she has a ritual.

    Not complicated. Not something she read about in a wellness article or saw on a reel. Just something she figured out works for her.

    She lights a candle.

    Dims the lights in her room, sometimes off completely, just the small flame and maybe the glow from her phone if it's nearby.

    Then she does her skincare routine. Slowly. Not the rushed version she does most nights when she's tired and just wants to sleep. The intentional kind. Each step deliberate, methodical.

    She'll sit there after, in front of the candle, and just... be.

    No phone scrolling. No reel watching. No studying or thinking about studying.

    Just her and the quiet and the small, flickering light.

    It's her version of therapy. Her reset button when everything feels like it's stacking up too high exams, deadlines, family expectations, the mental load of juggling everything at once, the general chaos of being herself and trying to have her life together.

    The candle doesn't solve anything. Doesn't make the syllabus shorter or easier or her room less messy.

    But it slows her down. Makes the air feel different. Gives her brain permission to stop running for a few minutes.

    She doesn't do it every night. Just when she needs it. When the day has been too much and she can feel herself getting tight and overwhelmed and too far inside her own head.

    The flame is small. Steady. Unbothered by anything happening outside its little radius of light.

    And for those few minutes before sleep, she gets to borrow that steadiness.

    Sit with it. Let it calm her down.

    Then blow it out, get into bed, and try again tomorrow.

    It's a small thing.

    But small things matter when the big things feel impossible to control.

    Stressed about exams or life or the general chaos of everything? Coffee.

    Fighting and need to actually talk it out instead of letting it sit and fester? Meet at a coffee shop.

    It became the default. The neutral ground. The place where things felt manageable.

    Doesn't matter what the situation was good day, bad day, normal day, complicated day coffee was the through line. The thing that made sense when nothing else did.

    She doesn't drink tea. Never do. But coffee? That's non negotiable.

    Morning coffee to actually wake up. Afternoon coffee when studying gets too dense and her brain needs a restart. Evening coffee sometimes, just because.

    And then there's the restriction conversation. The one that happens regularly.

    "Ketki, no. No excess coffee from now."

    She'll nod. Agree. Acknowledge that yes, maybe she's had too much caffeine today.

    Very next day:

    "Please. Just for today. I'm craving it."

    "You said you'd cut back."

    "I know, I know. But just this once. Please?"

    And somehow every single time she finds a way to convince.

    The pleading isn't dramatic. Just persistent. Gentle. She'll list reasons: she's tired, she has studying to do, she hasn't had that much today (debatable), she'll cut back tomorrow (also debatable).

    It doesn't matter how firm the restriction is. She'll negotiate her way around it. Not aggressively. Just... effectively.

    By the end of the conversation, there's coffee in her hand.

    And all those times sitting across from each other, hands wrapped around mugs, talking or not talking, just being there that became its own kind of ritual.

    Coffee shops weren't just about the coffee. They were about the pause. The space to breathe. The unspoken agreement that whatever needed to be said could be said here, over something warm and familiar.

    Even fights felt less sharp with coffee in hand. Something about sitting down, ordering, waiting for it to arrive it forced a slowdown. A chance to recalibrate before words got thrown around that couldn't be taken back.

    Some people sort things out over long walks or late night calls.

    At dusk they darken with desire.

    Turn fragile moments into faith.
    One glance, and suddenly I know
    There's nowhere else I need to go.

    The stars have learned them by heart.

    Grows jealous of her patient eyes.

    Of love unsaid, of time let go.

    She walks like a penguin.

    This is a scientific fact, confirmed by multiple witnesses.

    The discovery happened when the three of us were together; me, her, and Apoorva. We were just hanging out, nothing special, and then she got up to go somewhere.

    And we all saw it.

    The shuffle. The waddle. The slight side to side sway like she was navigating ice even though she was just walking across a normal floor.

    We looked at each other. The realization was instant. Unanimous.

    "You walk like a penguin."

    She denied it. Obviously. Insisted she walks completely normally, thank you very much.

    But the evidence was irrefutable. We'd all seen it. There was no going back.

    The teasing began immediately.

    And it hasn't stopped since.

    Because once you notice it, you can't unnotice it. Every time she gets up and starts moving especially at home when she's comfortable and not thinking about it there it is. The penguin walk.

    Feet shuffling. Barely lifting off the ground. That little waddle that makes her look like she's perpetually about to slip on ice that doesn't exist.

    It's adorable.

    Like, genuinely, really adorable.

    She looks so cute doing it, even though she has no idea she's doing it half the time.

    But here's the thing that makes it even better:

    She doesn't just walk like a penguin.

    She runs like one too.

    And it's the funniest thing in the world.

    Because she doesn't actually know how to run. Not properly, anyway.

    When she tries to run like actually move fast it's not running. It's speed waddling.

    Her arms don't pump right. Her feet don't coordinate. Her whole body just kind of... wobbles forward at a slightly increased pace while still maintaining full penguin energy.

    It's not athletic. It's not graceful. It's not efficient.

    It's hilariously cute.

    We've seen it happen. When she's late and trying to hurry. When she's excited and moving toward something. When she's being chased (playfully, obviously).

    The run is just the walk but faster and somehow even more penguin like.

    She gets teased for that too.

    "Ketki, that's not running."

    "Yes it is!"

    She'll protest. Defend her running form like it's a legitimate technique.

    But deep down, she knows.

    She's a penguin. In walk mode and run mode.

    There's even a stuffed penguin now. Pingu. Lives in her room. Became an official mascot of the whole situation.

    No one remembers when Pingu arrived or why it stayed, but it's there now. A permanent reminder that she is, in fact, a penguin in human form.

    And honestly?

    It's perfect.

    Because penguins are objectively adorable. They waddle around with full confidence even though they look ridiculous. They don't care. They just exist at their own pace, in their own way.

    She's the same.

    Moves through life however she wants. Doesn't rush unless she has to. And when she does, it's the cutest, funniest, most endearing version of rushing imaginable.

    The penguin energy is unmatched.

    And we wouldn't change it for anything.`,

    If someone asked me about Ketki, I'd call her the most beautiful creature in the world.

    But every creature has a creator, right?

    And in this case, the creator is just as beautiful as the creation.

    Smita kaku.

    Ketki's mom. Though sometimes it's hard to tell who's actually the mom in that relationship.

    Because here's the thing: Smita kaku was the most pampered kid in her family before marriage. An actual princess. The kind of daughter who was adored, protected, spoiled in all the best ways.

    And some part of her never stopped being that.

    She still carries that energy. The ease of someone who was loved without conditions. Who grew up knowing she was enough exactly as she was.

    She's cool. Beautiful. Smart. Confident in a way that doesn't need to announce itself.

    She loves herself as she is. Doesn't apologize for it. Doesn't shrink.

    That's rare.

    But when it comes to Ketki?

    Smita kaku becomes the kid.

    It's not a role reversal, exactly. It's more like... Ketki grew up faster in some ways. Became the responsible one. The planner. The one who remembers things and keeps track of logistics and makes sure everything runs smoothly.

    So sometimes (often), actually the family forgets who's supposed to be the mom.

    They'll turn to Ketki for decisions. For organization. For the final word on how things should go.

    And Smita kaku? She's fine with it. Doesn't fight it. Just lets Ketki be Ketki.

    They fight, obviously. The way mothers and daughters do when they're too similar in all the ways that matter and too different in all the ways that clash.

    But they also share everything.

    Gossip about the world. About people. About life.

    They talk the way friends talk. The way people talk when they trust each other enough to say the unfiltered version of their thoughts.

    There's a lightness between them. A ease.

    Even when they're arguing.

    Smita kaku isn't the stereotypical "traditional mom." She's not hovering or controlling or trying to mold Ketki into some fixed idea of what a daughter should be.

    She just lets her exist.

    And maybe that's why Ketki turned out the way she did.

    Because she was raised by someone who loved herself unapologetically and gave her daughter permission to do the same.

    The most beautiful creature in the world didn't come from nowhere.

    She came from someone who knew her own worth.

    Who carried herself with confidence and warmth and ease.

    Who was pampered and loved and never forgot what that felt like, so she made sure her daughter felt it too.

    Happy birthday, Smita kaku.

    Thank you for creating my favorite person.`,

    She loves jewelry.

    Especially earrings.

    Not the "I have a few pairs I rotate through" kind of love. The "I have a collection and I'm always adding more" kind.

    Big ones, small ones, jhumkas that move when she does, studs for everyday, statement pieces for occasions. Gold, silver, oxidized, colorful. Traditional, modern, somewhere in between.

    She wears them every single day.

    The simple stud for normal days barely noticeable, just there because it should be.

    But when she's going out? That's when the real decision happens.

    She'll stand in front of her jewelry box, consider her options, pick something that matches the outfit, the occasion, the mood. Heavy jhumkas for a wedding. Delicate hoops for something casual. Statement pieces when she wants to feel put together.

    Earrings aren't just an accessory for her. They're part of the whole assembly.

    The outfit gets chosen (and reconsidered). Jewelry comes next and earrings are always the priority.

    They frame her face. Change the energy of the whole look. Add weight or lightness depending on what she picks.

    And here's the thing about her earring obsession:

    If we're out somewhere, anywhere and she sees an earring stall, she will stop.

    Doesn't matter if we're in a rush. Doesn't matter if we have somewhere to be. Doesn't matter if we literally just talked about needing to leave.

    She sees earrings, she's checking them out.

    It's automatic. Non negotiable. A law of physics at this point.

    "Ketki, we need to go."

    "Just two minutes."

    (It's never two minutes.)

    She'll pick them up, hold them near her ears, tilt her head in that considering way. Ask my opinion even though she's already decided. Compare two pairs that look almost identical to me but are apparently completely different to her.

    "Which one?"

    "They're the same."

    "They're not the same. This one has more detail. This one is lighter."

    And then she'll buy one. Or both. Or neither, but only after a full deliberation process.

    Her collection is massive at this point. Overflowing. She has more earrings than any one person reasonably needs.

    But that doesn't stop her.

    A new pair catches her eye and suddenly it's essential. Perfect. Will go with everything (it won't, but she believes it).

    The jewelry box keeps expanding. A mix of favorites she wears on repeat and impulse buys she hasn't gotten around to yet but will, definitely, someday.

    Some people window shop casually.

    She has a specific target: earring stalls.

    And she never misses one.`,

    She doesn't like red roses.

    Not in a "they're fine I guess" way. In a genuine "please don't give me those" way.

    Red is the color of love. Red is what you give to partners. Red is cliché. Red is... just not her thing.

    She's made this clear. Multiple times. To multiple people.

    If someone shows up with red roses, she'll accept them politely because she's not rude but internally she's already decided they're going in a vase somewhere.

    It's not about the gesture. It's about the color.

    Red feels too obvious. Too performative. Too "this is what you're supposed to give to your partner because someone decided it means romance."

    She doesn't want the default option.

    She wants something that actually feels like her.

    Sunflowers, though?

    Those are different.

    Bright. Warm. Unapologetically cheerful. They don't try to be romantic or delicate or symbolically loaded.

    They're just... happy.

    Big, bold, facing the sun like they have nothing to prove.

    She loves them.

    And so do I.

    It's one of those rare things we both agree on without needing to discuss it. No debate. No compromise. Just mutual, immediate appreciation.

    Sunflowers don't need meaning attached to them. They exist loudly and brightly and that's enough.

    They're not trying to be elegant or sophisticated or fit into some predetermined idea of what a flower should represent.

    They just are.

    Which is probably why she loves them.

    Because she's the same way.

    Doesn't fit into neat categories. Doesn't perform what people expect. Just exists fully as herself bright, unbothered, taking up space without apology.

    Red roses could never.

    Sunflowers, though?

    Those get it.

    Happy Rose Day to my pretty fool 💕.

    text: `Almost two years ago, we made a bet.
There was a game. A challenge. The stakes were simple: whoever wins gets a ramen date.
I won.
And I still haven't gotten my treat.
She'll bring it up sometimes. "I know, I know. I owe you ramen."
And then... nothing. Life happens. Time passes. The debt remains unpaid.
It's become a running joke at this point. The ramen date that will happen someday. Eventually. When she decides the time is right.
(Which, knowing her, could be tomorrow or three years from now.)
But here's the thing: we both love ramen.
Not just eating it. Cooking it too.
She's good at it. Really good. Knows how to get the broth right, how to cook the noodles so they're not too soft, how to layer the toppings in a way that makes it look like it came from an actual restaurant.
When she came over to my place, we cooked together.
Actually, she cooked. I was the assistant.
Because when she's cooking, interference is not welcome.
She has a system. A rhythm. A way things need to be done.
My job was simple: hand her things when asked, stay out of the way otherwise, and definitely don't offer unsolicited suggestions about how to do something.
I followed instructions. She did the rest.
And it was delicious.
The kind of delicious that makes you understand why people get territorial about cooking. Because when you know what you're doing, you don't need someone else's input messing up the flow.
Ramen, sushi, tteokbokki—Asian cuisine is our thing. The food we both get excited about. The kind of meal that feels like an event, not just eating.
We have nicknames, even. Kimbap and Gimbap.
Hers and mine. A pair. A set.
The kind of inside joke that doesn't make sense to anyone else but makes perfect sense to us.
So yeah, she still owes me that ramen date.
But honestly? I'm not in a rush.
Because the best ramen we've had wasn't at a restaurant anyway.
It was the one she made. In my kitchen. With me as her slightly useless but enthusiastic assistant.
That one's hard to beat.
Even if it technically doesn't count as paying off the bet.
(It doesn't. I'm still owed. Just to be clear.)

Gimbap loves you a lot, Kimbap.`
